        Thanks so much for your email.  Currently, CBIS is not in need of a video production service.  
        However, we do have a full-suite of offerings to help get JLB Media in front of the right people in the association space.
        
        I’ve copied my colleague Marlayna, who can assist you in getting access to the tool that’ll get 
        you to the decision makers who might be interested in your powerful video production service.
        
        As well, we host a dozen events throughout the year, a good chunk of them with focus to our technology partners.  
        Perhaps it’d make sense to have JLB present here for branding as well.
        
        Let us know if we can help with any of the above and we’ll go from there!
